            During the summer of 2021 I worked as a Software Developer Intern for Invia Medical Imaging Solutions. Inviaâ€™s main product is an application which reads in heart scans stored in large databases 
            and performs processing on the images to reconstruct a 3D representation of the heart. Once the images are processed the product then allows doctors to easily disect and 
            view slices of the heart, and will highlight key information about the slices that makes them easier to interpret. 
            <br><br>
            Over the course of the summer I used C++/CLI, C#, SQLite, and the .NET Framework to solve the issue of high latency when copying a database across a network. There are 
            particular types of scans, which generate a large amount of very small image files, which are difficult to transfer across a network since for each image transferred 
            there is overhead when connecting to the destination computer, and incurring this overhead for each image transferred led to immense latency. I worked with the 
            excellent Invia engineers to solve this problem, by creating a service, which could identify these particular images and package them into a zip archive. As a result of this, 
            I had to add functionality to the product to process a database that has zip archives in it, and also process the images within the zip archive. By the end of 
            the summer, the product was capable of reading in database files which were zipped, and transferring a database across a network became 10x faster. 
            <br><br>
            This experience taught me a lot about what it is like to work on a professional software development team, developing windows services and applications, 
            multi-threading, and several programming languages I was unfamiliar with. The project manager gave me a lot of freedom to employ my own problem-solving and creative abilities 
            in solving the many challenges I encountered, which allowed me to take ownership and pride in what I did. This internship was an incredible learning experience for me and 
            it was a lot of fun to work with the Invia staff and contribute a product feature that will actually be shipped.
