# jquery.youtube-background

Another 100 liner in a form of jQuery plugin created to facilitate YouTube embeds as a cover background using YouTube Embed API.

I wrote this code several times over the years and never bothered to make it reusable. Now when I needed it again I could not even find where I wrote it last...

Goodbye careless days... I'm getting old...

[DEMO HERE â¤»](http://stamat.github.io/jquery.youtube-background/)

## Usage

Usage is pretty simple, add a data attribute **data-youtube** containing a full YouTube link or just the YouTube ID.

You can trigger all elements containing the noted attribute with `$("[data-youtube]").expandable();`, or specify your selector, on jQuery document ready event.

P.S. *https://www.youtube.com/player_api* is injected automatically, only once per script init. I've seen some implementations like Elementor WP plugin that inject it several times, for no reason. Anyway, you're welcome.

#### Example

```
    <div id="ytbg" data-youtube="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEpEeyqGlxA"></div>
    
    <script type="text/javascript">
        jQuery(document).ready(function() {
            $('[data-youtube]').youtube_background();
        });
    </script>
```

THE END.
