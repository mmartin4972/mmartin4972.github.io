	1. Book Used: Beginning JavaScript: The Ultimate Guide to Modern JavaScript Development
	2. Chapter 3
		a. Create variables in JavaScript using keyword var
		b. No type necessary
		c. Can use const to prevent variables from being reassigned
		d. Use let keyword for variables to have scope; otherwise accessible anywhere
			i. For(let I = 0; I < 10; i++)
		e. Variable Hoisting: compiler moves variable to the beginning of scope
		f. You can declare a variable after you've used a variable
		g. Declare variable in function hoisted to top of function and declare one outside of function hoisted to top of page
		h. Can declare variables without using var or let but just giving them a name
		i. Can run code in strict mode in browser which is good way of debugging
	3. Chapter 4
		a. Objects are used to store complex data sets in JavaScript
		b. Document is an object and lets you explore HTML page inside browswer
		c. Math object lets you do math
		d. Date Object returns date and will help you calculated future dates
		e. Native Objects: Objects built into JavaScript
			i. Object
			ii. Array
			iii. Promise
			iv. JSON
		f. Host Objects: objects that are part of environment that code runs in
			i. Window
			ii. Document
			iii. History
			iv. Navigator
		g. Methods are functions that allow you to perform a process on specific data
		h. Arrays hold data and keep it in order
		i. Create array by setting a variable = to new Array() or []
		j. Indices can be referenced with array[i]
		k. myArray.length will provide the length of the array
		l. Array can hold onto any data type doesn't have to be homogenous
		m. myArray.forEach((value,index,array)=> {  … });
		n. Filter method generates new array based on results of test criterion you give it
		o. Map method used to iterate through array and modify values in some way
		p. Filter(value,index, array) =>
		q. Map(value, currentvalue, currentindex, array) =>
		r. Reduce lets you perform operation on array and condense into one thing 
	4. Chapter 5
		a. Functions require:
			i. Name
			ii. Optional list of arguments
			iii. Code that performs operation surrounded by curly braces
			iv. Returns a value to where the function was called
			v. Arrow function ex a shorter way of creating function expression
			vi. (parameters) => { num1+num2};
			vii. If function is only one line JavaScript does implicit return
			viii. If you have no parameters can use empty parenthesis or underscore
			ix. Functions created inside another function are able to be access all parts of the outer function
			x. Functions created in other functions aren't accessible to outside scope
	5. Chapter 6
		a. Events occur whenever the user does anything to the webpage
		b. addEventListener is a method that allows you to check for events
		c. Parameters are (event, function to execute)
			https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events 
		d. Above is a list of events
		e. DOMContentLoaded lets you know that content of page is loaded into browser
		f. PreventDefualt prevents browser from performing its normal functions when using links or forms
		g. If you want to know about event can put variable in function parameter and when eventListener is executed it will pass details of event object to function and function parameter.target can be used to operate on the object
		h. Using the target method allows you to see exactly which button was pressed
		i. querySelector method seraches for object specified in its parameters
		j. If you have a parent object and an object within the parent and event listeners on both and you add the same eventListeners to both objects the event will propogate up the eventListeners in the order written in the code, which is called event bubbling
		k. Can run stopPropogation method so that if object is pushed doesn't react and say the div was also clicked
		l. Can create custom event using new CustomEvent("Name", { });
		m. And can then dispacth the event using method dispatchEvent(Event name)
