                    The Michigan Mars Rover team is a student organization that constructs a robot to compete in a Mars themed competition. I joined the perception sub-team 
                    in the fall of 2019 and have been a member ever since. The perception sub-team focuses on capturing and processing the environment around the rover to identify
                    specific objects and avoid obstacles. To learn more about the MROVER team check out their <a href="https://mrover.org" target="_blank">website.</a>

                    For the 2021-2022 school year I was selected to be the autonomy branch lead of the Michigan Mars Rover team. The autonomy branch consists of 4 sub-teams: Perception, 
                    Localization, Navigation, and Simulation. As the branch lead it is my responsibility to manage the interactions of the various sub-teams and ensure that they are 
                    keeping up with the goals and objectives they set forth. This year, I am primarily focused on managing the transition of the autonomy system from a Lightweight 
                    Communications and Marshalling (LCM) based system to a Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) model, with higher bandwidth inter-process communications. To 
                    prepare myself for this transition I spent a lot of time researching SLAM over the summer, watching lectures by Cyrill Stachniss on path planning, occupancy grids, 
                    Kalman filters, and localization. After watching these lectures, I was able to establish and collaborate with the other sub-team leads to create a conclusive vision 
                    for the system, define the necessary interfaces, and establish a roadmap for completing the system before our competition in the summer of 2022.
                    <br><br>
                    Leading the transition to SLAM taught me the importance of planning and ensuring I got the input of everyone involved in the project. By collaborating closely with 
                    the sub-team leads I was able to use their expertise of their sub-systems to develop a roadmap for accommodating SLAM which requires minimal changes and was able to 
                    ensure that they were onboard with the system and could take ownership of their part of the project. Currently, we are working diligently to transition to this SLAM 
                    based system, so that we can dominate in our competition next summer.

                    For the 2020-2021 term I was selected to be the Perception sub-team Lead. Currently, the sub-team has 13 members, including myself, which
                    is twice as many as the number of people that were on the sub-team last year. I believe that my philosophy of leading through service, my project management skills, 
                    and my enthusiasm for the team are what has allowed for our sub-team to dramatically grow despite Coronavirus Pandemic. 
                    <br><br>
                    My leading through service philosophy has led me to spend a lot of time teaching my members and providing them with the tools they need to be successful on the 
                    sub-team. During sub-team meetings I primarily spend my time working with the other members of the team, providing them with the background of our code base they 
                    need to tackle their projects, helping them setup and maintain their git work environments, and helping them to troubleshoot problems that they are stuck on. 
                    I have spent much time working on making our complex and computationally intensive development environment easily accessible to members. I work on my own team 
                    projects outside of team meetings to ensure that I have the time to work with my team during meetings. I believe that by investing a lot of time in and serving 
                    my team members I have helped them to enhance their coding skills, as well as earned their respect, which makes them more willing to follow my instruction.

                    Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is a combat sport that focuses on grappling from the ground. It is physically and mentally challenging as you must utilize good technique, 
                    so that you can manipulate your opponent effectively without using up too much of your own energy. It is a humbling sport as good technique will overcome great strength
                    and allows you to get beat up by individuals far smaller than yourself. I have been doing gi Jiu Jitsu when I was younger from 2013-2017 and since going to college in 2019 have
                    been training in no gi Jiu Jitsu, which I enjoy much more.

                    Over the summer of 2021 I was asked to be the Vice President of the Blue Jitsu club at the University of Michigan. As the vice president it is my responsibility to work with 
                    the president and the rest of the leadership team to help train new members, host recruiting events, informational events, and manage club logistics. Throughout the semester 
                    we will coordinate and host training sessions to teach new individuals the fundamentals of grappling, so that they don’t feel overwhelmed when first going to the club. The 
                    members of the club go regularly to the Final Round Training Center where they can get professional Jiu Jitsu instruction from the mentors there. By teaching new members the 
                    fundamentals of Jiu Jitsu I’ve learned to pay close attention to details within the technique and to articulate these details carefully to beginners, so as to minize their mistakes.

                    Scouting taught me what it means to lead through service and has helped me to become the man I am today.

                   For my Eagle Project I organized and led a 5 day FIRST Robotics based summer camp. The camp introduced middle schoolers to high school
                   level robotics, teaching them basic mechanical, electrical, and programming skills. 
                   <br><br>
                   Campers were taught these skills by designing and constructing a spray paint machine.
                   The campers, with assistance from the high school staffers, cut, drilled, and riveted an aluminum structure to hold a can of spray paint and a pneumatic piston to activate it.
                   They then wired the pneumatic piston to a solenoid that was controlled by a Raspberry Pi connected to a custom circuit they made using a bread board. They finally programmed 
                   the raspberry pi to activate the solenoid when a limit switch was pressed. 
                   <br><br>
                   It was a complex project, but was extremely rewarding for me as I learned the importance of planning, training volunteers,
                   and being able to improvise when things don't go as planned. For a better view of the completed project check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/gfn87dmHWdI" target="_blank">video.</a>

                   As Senior Patrol Leader I was responsible for managing the troop. I planned out the weekly meetings, made sure the patrols were properly organizing and preparing for campouts,
                   and lead the patrols during campouts. Being Senior Patrol Leader was an incredible learning experience for me as I learned to work with adults and how to maintain authority
                   over the members of the troop, even though I was delegating assignments that many scouts would've preferred not to do. 
                   <br><br>
                   I practiced leading by serving, by assisting all the patrols whenever possible and in doing so, I was able to earn the respect of the members in the troop. By earning their 
                   respect, they were willing to listen to my direction and performed the tasks that I needed them to do. Maintaining this respect was a challenging, and I made many mistakes during
                   my time as Senior Patrol Leader; however, I always made sure that I admitted and apologized for making such mistakes, and the scouts didn't think lesser of me. Leading by serving 
                   is a philosophy that I live by since, I was able to experience its effectiveness whilst being the Senior Patrol Leader.

                   FIRST Robotics is a highly competitive high school robotics program. FIRST aims to introduce high schoolers to advanced robotic technology, create a firm foundation for students in
                   the various fields pertaining to robotics, and encourage them to take a leading role in tackling engineering problems. I was a member from my school's FIRST Robotics team from 2017-2019
                   and being a part of that team was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. For more information about FIRST Robotics check out their <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/" target="_blank">website.</a>

                   Being the Team Captain of my High School Robotics Team for the 2019 season was one of the greatest expereiences of my life. Robotics is something I am extremely passionate about and when I was given
                   the opportunity to lead the team, I was able to fully commit myself to the team. My total committment to the team allowed me to gain the respect of the students and mentors on the team, allowed me
                   to be an effective leader, and have a ton of fun while doing so. During the 2019 6 weeks build season I spent over 30 hours a week, designing the robot, coordinating the various sub-teams, helping 
                   out the sub-teams when they fell behind, and enforcing or adapting our schedule to ensure deadlines were met. 
                   <br><br>
                   That year was the first year that we designed and manufactured all the major components of the robot, as opposed to buying a kit with directions, as we had done in previous years. I pushed the team
                   to work harder than ever before that year, scheduling many extra hours of build time to make sure deadlines were met and making sure people were staying on task and getting things done. There were a lot
                   of bumps along the way, I made many mistakes and had many components developed that were not effective or functional. However, I viewed these failures and setbacks as learning experiences and iterations 
                   towards developing more effective and functional components. In the end, all our hard work came to fruition when the team won a district competition. It was one of the best days of my life, as I got to
                   see not only my hard work, but the hard work of everyone on the team manifest. The whole team felt pride for what they had accomplished, for many were just as committed as I was, and I was extremely proud 
                   of my team.
