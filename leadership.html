                    The Michigan Mars Rover team is a student run project team that constructs a robot to compete in a Mars themed competition. I joined the perception subtem 
                    in the fall of 2019 and have been a member ever since. The perception subteam focuses on capturing and processing the environment around the rover to identify
                    specific objects and avoid obstacles. To learn more about the MROVER team check out their <a href="https://mrover.org">website.</a>

                    For the 2020-2021 term I was selected to be the Perception Subteam Lead. As the subteam lead I select and direct several projects
                    that the subteam will focus on for the year. This year the perception team will be focusing on detecting AR Tags and implementing the point cloud 
                    library to identify and avoid obstacles. 
                    <br><br>
                    AR Tag detection utilizes the ArUco library and OpenCV to process an RGB image to detect and identify the id and bearing of AR Tags in the environment.
                    <br><br>
                    Point Cloud based obstacle avoidance utilizes the Point Cloud library and images gathered from a ZED Stereo Camera to create a 3D Point Cloud of the environment.
                    The program then uses various filtering techniques and algorithms to remove the ground plane and identify clusters of objects in space. Once these objects are identified
                    the program detects whether the center path of the rover is obstructed. If it is obstructed the program uses trigonometry to calculate a new path for the rover to follow.
                    Over the summer of 2020 I developed a proof of concept for this system. For a better view of the demo check out this <a href="#">video.</a> Here is the

                    Scouts BSA, formerly called "The Boy Scouts of America", is a program dedicated to instilling core principals in its members
                    that enable and empower them to be future leaders. I began my scouting journey during 2014 in Troop 777 based in Northville, MI.
                    Scouting taught me what it means to lead through service and has helped me to become the man I am today.

                   For my Eagle Project I organized and lead a 5 day FIRST Robotics based summer camp. The camp introduced middle schoolers to high school
                   level robotics, teaching them basic mechanical, electrical, and programming skills. 
                   <br><br>
                   Campers were taught these skills by designing and constructing a spray paint machine.
                   The campers, with assistance from the high school staffers, cut, drilled, and riveted an aluminum structure to hold a can of spray paint and a pneumatic piston to activate it.
                   They then wired the pneumatic piston to a solenoid that was controlled by a Raspberry Pi connected to a custom circuit they made using a bread board. They finally programmed 
                   the raspberry pi to activate the solenoid when a limit switch was pressed. 
                   <br><br>
                   It was a complex project, but was extremely rewarding for me as I learned the importance of planning, training volunteers,
                   and being able to improvise when things don't go as planned. For a better view of the completed project check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/gfn87dmHWdI">video.</a>

                   As Senior Patrol Leader I was responsible for managing the troop. I planned out the weekly meetings, made sure the patrols were properly organizing and preparing for campouts,
                   and lead the patrols during campouts. Being Senior Patrol Leader was an incredible learning experience for me as I learned to work with adults and how to maintain authority
                   over the members of the troop, even though I was delegating assignments that many scouts would've preferred not to do. 
                   <br><br>
                   I practiced leading by serving, by assisting all the patrols whenever possible and in doing so, I was able to earn the respect of the members in the troop. By earning their 
                   respect, they were willing to listen to my direction and performed the tasks that I needed them to do. Maintaining this respect was a challenging, and I made many mistakes during
                   my time as Senior Patrol Leader; however, I always made sure that I admitted and apologized for making such mistakes, and the scouts didn't think lesser of me. Leading by serving 
                   is a philosophy that I live by since, I was able to experience its effectiveness whilst being the Senior Patrol Leader.

                   FIRST Robotics is a highly competitive high school robotics program. FIRST aims to introduce high schoolers to advanced robotic technology, create a firm foundation for students in
                   the various fields pertaining to robotics, and encourage them to take a leading role in tackling engineering problems. I was a member from my school's FIRST Robotics team from 2017-2019
                   and being a part of that team was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. For more information about FIRST Robotics check out their <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/">website.</a>

                   Being the Team Captain of my High School Robotics Team for the 2019 season was one of the greatest expereiences of my life. Robotics is something I am extremely passionate about and when I was given
                   the opportunity to lead the team, I was able to fully commit myself to the team. My total committment to the team allowed me to gain the respect of the students and mentors on the team, allowed me
                   to be an effective leader, and have a ton of fun while doing so. During the 2019 6 weeks build season I spent over 30 hours a week, designing the robot, coordinating the various subteams, helping 
                   out the subteams when they fell behind, and enforcing or adapting our schedule to ensure deadlines were met. 
                   <br><br>
                   That year was the first year that we designed and manufactured all the major components of the robot, as opposed to buying a kit with directions, as we had done in previous years. I pushed the team
                   to work harder than ever before that year, scheduling many extra hours of build time to make sure deadlines were met and making sure people were staying on task and getting things done. There were a lot
                   of bumps along the way, I made many mistakes had many components developed that were not effective or functional. However, I viewed these failures and setbacks as learning experiences and iterations 
                   towards developing more effective and functional components. In the end, all our hard work came to fruition when the team won a district competition. It was one of the best days of my life, as I got to
                   see not only my hard work, but the hard work of everyone on the team manifest. The whole team felt pride for what they had accomplished, for many were just as committed as I was, and I was extremely proud 
                   of my team.
