                    The Michigan Mars Rover team is a student run project team that constructs a robot to compete in a Mars themed competition. I joined the perception subtem 
                    in the fall of 2019 and have been a member ever since. The perception subteam focuses on capturing and processing the environment around the rover to identify
                    specific objects and avoid obstacles. To learn more about the MROVER team check out their <a href="https://mrover.org">website.</a>

                    For the 2020-2021 term I was selected to be the Perception Subteam Lead. As the subteam lead I select and direct several projects
                    that the subteam will focus on for the year. This year the perception team will be focusing on detecting AR Tags and implementing the point cloud 
                    library to identify and avoid obstacles. 
                    <br><br>
                    AR Tag detection utilizes the ArUco library and OpenCV to process an RGB image to detect and identify the id and bearing of AR Tags in the environment.
                    <br><br>
                    Point Cloud based obstacle avoidance utilizes the Point Cloud library and images gathered from a ZED Stereo Camera to create a 3D Point Cloud of the environment.
                    The program then uses various filtering techniques and algorithms to remove the ground plane and identify clusters of objects in space. Once these objects are identified
                    the program detects whether the center path of the rover is obstructed. If it is obstructed the program uses trigonometry to calculate a new path for the rover to follow.
                    Over the summer of 2020 I developed a proof of concept for this system. For a better view of the demo check out this <a href="#">video.</a>

                    Scouts BSA, formerly called "The Boy Scouts of America", is a program dedicated to instilling core principals in its members
                    that enable and empower them to be future leaders. I began my scouting journey during 2014 in Troop 777 based in Northville, MI.
                    Scouting taught me what it means to lead through service and has helped me to become the man I am today.

                   For my Eagle Project I organized and lead a 5 day FIRST Robotics based summer camp. The camp introduced middle schoolers to high school
                   level robotics, teaching them basic mechanical, electrical, and programming skills. 
                   <br><br>
                   Campers were taught these skills by designing and constructing a spray paint machine.
                   The campers, with assistance from the high school staffers, cut, drilled, and riveted an aluminum structure to hold a can of spray paint and a pneumatic piston to activate it.
                   They then wired the pneumatic piston to a solenoid that was controlled by a Raspberry Pi connected to a custom circuit they made using a bread board. They finally programmed 
                   the raspberry pi to activate the solenoid when a limit switch was pressed. 
                   <br><br>
                   It was a complex project, but was extremely rewarding for me as I learned the importance of planning, training volunteers,
                   and being able to improvise when things don't go as planned. For a better view of the completed project check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/gfn87dmHWdI">video.</a>

                   As Senior Patrol Leader I was responsible for managing the troop. I planned out the weekly meetings, made sure the patrols were properly organizing and preparing for campouts,
                   and lead the patrols during campouts. Being Senior Patrol Leader was an incredible learning experience for me as I learned to work with adults and how to maintain authority
                   over the members of the troop, even though I was delegating assignments that many scouts would've preferred not to do. I practiced leading by serving, through ensuring I assisted
