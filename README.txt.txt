Website Vision 3/21/20:
1. Website will load on to main home page containing various basic statistics about myself including GPA, skills, courses, and other
generic information
2. The Website is going to have 3 different layouts for desktop, tablet, and phone modes and all three are going to have different hover
and click functionalities to make navigation on any device rather nice
3. Navigation bar is going to be the most complex element 
	a. It is going to be made up of buttons that are easily able to call java script functions to trigger various actions
	b. When in iphone mode the navigation bar at the top will be condensed into a 3 bar button that will then pop out a vertical list
	   that is the navigation bar
	c. Functionality will remain constant when in tablet and desktop mode the main differences being the hover
	d. The navigation bar will always remain and be visible at the top of the page and is going to be subtle and not too large
	e. Hover effect are going to be generic for each web page
	f. When a page loads for a desktop or tablet there is going to be a title picture at the top of the page 
	g. Buttons on the navigation bar are going to be evenly spaced and centered
	h. There is going to be a profile icon or some sort of symbol that is going to indicate where home is as opposed to just
	the word home cause that looks really bad
	i. On loading the profile page a video will play and the navigation bar will appear as nothing but white text while the video
	plays and the vide is going to take up the entire page see hyperlite homepage for inspiration
	j. After this the user will be able to scroll down and the navigation bar will regain color once passing a certain point
	k. Also looking at the hyperlite website when the projects tab is hovered over a drop down will appear including pictures and
	and titles for all projects
	l. In mobile you won't be able to hover, so when you click it will take you to a page that provides this same effect and if you click 	
	on the desktop projects page it will also have this same effect
	m. Pages will be home(icon), MROVER, Scouts, Projects, FIRST, Fun
	n. Home has the video effect
	o. MROVER will just load the MROVER page and it should have a really cool scrolling image effect like apple does where the image scrolls
	slower than the page and it appears like the background is the image for a second as you scroll to next section
	p. Scouts will also just load page and have cool formatting
	q. Projects is going to have the drop down for various projects
	r. FIRST is going to just load the page
	s. Fun is going to just load the page
4. Pages
	a. Have a timline page that is a vertical graphical representation of basically links to all your pages including FIRST stuff, Eagle,
	   stuff, MROVER stuff, basically everything
	b. Have a contact page so that people can contact you
	c. Make sure in projects and MROVER tabs you have dates of all projects and when page loads put dates of stuff in upper right hand corner
	   so that people know what your most recent projects are
	d. You may want to consider having people request access to view your website, since you have personal information on there and it would
	   be cool to set up a security system like that
