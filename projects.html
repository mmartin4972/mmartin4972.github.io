                    The Michigan Mars Rover team is a student run project team that constructs a robot to compete in a Mars themed competition. I joined the perception subtem 
                    in the fall of 2019 and have been a member ever since. The perception subteam focuses on capturing and processing the environment around the rover to identify
                    specific objects and avoid obstacles. To learn more about the MROVER team check out their <a href="https://mrover.org">website.</a>
