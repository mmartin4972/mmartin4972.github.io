Project Start: 3/21/20

This website was written entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. The YouTube Video player is a plugin created by pupunzi,
who did an incredible job creating it. The contact form was based on code written by "freecontactform.com". Insipration for the effects of this 
site came from hyperlite.com.  Implementation of these effects and all other aspects of the website is completely original.
