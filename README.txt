Project Start: 3/21/20

This website was written entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. Insipration for this site came from hyperlite.com. 
Much of the coding structure and effects are modeled off of their site; however, the implementation of all website functionality is 
completely original. Being able to model off of this site proved very helful for me in making this, my first, website. Default.js was
written using just Javascript. Other javascript files use jQuery.
