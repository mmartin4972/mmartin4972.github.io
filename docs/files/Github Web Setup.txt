I used this link to a website that had very helpful information on how to setup a 
github site. Super cool and helpful
http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/

run 'bundle exec jekyll serve' to host webpage on local machine after installing 
ruby on rails and jekyll plug in

If running in docker may run into a char not recognized error may have to run the below:
  - apt install locales
  - export LC_ALL="C.UTF-8"
  - export LANG="C.UTF-8"
